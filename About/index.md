Hi, I’m Bhavnesh. I was born in Rajasthan, India, and I am currently based in Chicago, USA, where I am a PhD student in theoretical and computational chemistry.

It took me a year and a half of synthesizing and eluting spiropyran-based metal sensors on columns to realize that I could better pursue my ideas about probing molecules by shifting to the domain of theoretical chemistry. During my master’s at IIT Bombay, India, I worked on developing wave-function-based methods with a focus on spectroscopic techniques. I was also a visiting summer scholar at the University of Minnesota, where I worked with Prof. Don Truhlar and gained experience in multireference methods and density functional theory.For my Ph.D., I aim to develop lower-scaling wave-function-based methods for strongly correlated systems.

Not your usual cricket aficionado, in my spare time—when my computational jobs are running on the cluster in the background-you can find me with a hot cup of coffee/tea, brainstorming new business ideas and ruminating on the fate of my stocks in the share market.
